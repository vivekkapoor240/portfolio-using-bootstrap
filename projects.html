        <h2>SIMON GAME</h2>
        <a href="https://vivekkapoor240.github.io/simonGame/">Play</a>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The Simon game is a classic electronic memory game that challenges players to remember and repeat a series of randomly generated patterns. I created a web-based version of this game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
            <li>In this project, I designed and implemented the user interface for the game using HTML and CSS. I used JavaScript to handle the game logic, such as generating the random patterns, tracking the player's progress, and handling user input. I also incorporated sound effects to enhance the game experience.</li>
            <li>One of the main challenges I faced during the development process was creating the logic to generate the random patterns and verify the player's input. I spent a lot of time debugging and testing my code to ensure that the game worked correctly and smoothly.</li>          
            <li>Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to improve my front-end web development skills, as well as my knowledge of JavaScript programming and game design principles. It was a fun and engaging project to work on, and I'm proud of the final product.</li>
